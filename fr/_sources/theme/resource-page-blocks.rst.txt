Resource page blocks
====================

OctopusViewer provides 4 different blocks that you can `place on resource pages
<https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/sites/site_theme/#configure-resource-pages>`__.

Octopus viewer
--------------

Available for: item, media.

This is the full viewer, with two sidebars. One contains a media selector and
the other contains metadata about the selected media.

The media selector is disabled on a media page.

Octopus viewer media selector

Available for: item.

This is the media selector. It displays the item's media and allows users to

updates them.
