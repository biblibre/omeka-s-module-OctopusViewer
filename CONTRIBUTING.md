## I have a question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available
> [documentation](https://biblibre.github.io/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing
[issues](https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/issues) that might
help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification,
you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the
[Omeka forum](https://forum.omeka.org/) for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we
recommend the following:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting bugs

#### Before submitting a bug report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect
information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete
the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as
possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g.
  using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have
  read the [documentation](https://biblibre.github.io/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the
  same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report
  existing for your bug or error in the
  [bug tracker](https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/issues).
- Also make sure to search the [Omeka forum](https://forum.omeka.org/) to see
  if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Version of Omeka S, PHP, and any other software possibly related to the bug
  - Other enabled modules and their versions. If possible disable other modules
    to check if the bug is caused by a conflict with another module.

#### How do I submit a good bug report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with
the project:

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction
  steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. For
  good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test
  case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If
  there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the
  team will ask you for those steps.

### Suggesting enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
this module, **including completely new features and minor improvements to
existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and
the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before submitting an enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://biblibre.github.io/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/)
  carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an
  individual configuration.
- Search in [issues](https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/issues)
  to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a
  comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's
  up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the
  merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be
  useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're
  just targeting a minority of users, consider writing another module.

#### How do I submit a good enhancement suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-s-module-OctopusViewer/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
  suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as
  many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected
  to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives
  do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you
  demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related
  to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users. You may also
  want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could
  serve as inspiration.
